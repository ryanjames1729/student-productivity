# Student Productivity

## About
*I am currently building out this site.*

The purpose of this site is to allow for students and teachers to work collaboratively on a TODO list. The idea is to take a student's TODO list that they may have in their notebooks and make it digital while giving their teacher's access to this. Then students and teachers can mark things as done or TODO to help students learn how to organize better.

## Using the Site
*TODO the app is not complete and needs more to be built*
You can visit [myFocus](https://student-productivity.vercel.app/) to get started. The landing page gives you an option to sign in or to view the demo for the app.


## Tech Stack
I built this site using [NextJS](https://astro.build), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) for CSS, [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com) for the GraphQL, and I deployed the site with [Vercel](https://vercel.com). 

### NextJS
